    <h2>A New Beginning</h2>
    <div class="pretty"><p>     Growing up, I struggled socializing. I spent most of my time at competitive gymnastics training, and had no time for myself.
        Because of that, I didn't really learn social cues, as gymnastics was a solo sport, with little to no
        teamwork involved. I had gymnastics everyday after school for around 4 hours, except for Fridays. On top of that,
        I had a private and went to open gym on Saturdays for around 3 hours. In total, I was doing upwards of 22 hours
        of gymnastics a week. Because of this, I did homework, often late at night in hopes of finishing it before class
        the next day. I wasn't ever behind, just exhausted, and I rarely got the proper sleep I was supposed to get.</p>

    <br>
    <p>     This was my life, up until my freshman year of High school. That year, all of the upper level coaches Quit
        Because I was an upper level gymnast, no one could coach me. There wasn't a coach left on roster qualified 
        to coach me. Thus I had to find something else to do. Many gymnasts before me transferred to cheerleading 
        the moment they got in high school, and I assumed I would do the same. I tried out, and was told I had some of the 
        best tumbling they have ever seen. Just one problem: I couldn't dance. The coach that helped me with my cheer tryouts
        happened to be a dance director. She approached me afterwards, and asked me if I would be willing to try out. I, who
        was never known to be coordinated enough to turn, began my 3 month preperation for tryouts in August. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>     Now to be honest, I was terrified. I had never been able to turn, and I wasn't exactly known for my leaps. I, however
        had a few advantages of my own. If there is one thing gymanstics taught me, it was to keep going even when you didn't 
        know the next move, or if you were injured. You need to leave everything on that stage. Because of this belief, I had no problem
        improvising, and adding emotion to a dance I learned the same day. I, as well, had the advantage of difficulty and tricks
        Because Acro is often considered harder than Turns or leaps, there is an advantage to having atleast one acrobatic on your Team,
        that was me. Because of these advantages I made the top team, and started to truly learn how to work with a team.

    <div class="center"><h2>So, how does scoring play into this?</h2></div>
    <p> <div class="right">    Dancing is all done on a point system. Some skills or categories are weighed more heavily than others. Because 
        of this, Its an advantage to prioritize the top categories, while touching up on the lower categories. They are 
        as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Technique
            <ul><li> Difficulty of Skill performed</li>
            <li>How Technically correct that skill is</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Performance 
            <ul><li>Showmanship</li>
            <li>facial Expressions</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Choreography</li>
        <li>Costume
            <Ul> <li> Makeup</li>
            <li>Clothing</li>
        <li> and Props</li></Ul>

   <div class = "last"><p>In a lot of ways, Dance has been my peace. My escape from the world. Unfortunately, our world does not see as much peace as dance brings me. Because of this, I think its important we all find what gives us peace, so one day, we can world peace. I find peace in dancing because I feel the most like myself. I have placed a map of world peace in the last few years to the right of where I am writing this. It is interactive. I wonder how much that map would change, if we all would dance more.<p>click<a href = "#top">  here</a> to go back to the top</p></p></div>
